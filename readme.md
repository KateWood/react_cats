# React Cats App

I started with a boilerplate built using the [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) course [The Complete React Web Developer Course by Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course).

I then added About and Cat components. There is currently no database connected to this app - all of the cats are hard-coded.
